# FieldHv_Pop_Genomics
# The following scripts were used for Hv popgen data analysis

pyrethroidResistance_AnalysisforAlexD.R - for the candidate gene analysis
bowtieScript - to align reads to my reference genome using Bowtie2
stacks_refmap_script - to cluster my reference genome aligned reads.
populations.sh - to get summary data from Stacks, enabling me to see which ddRAD-seq markers aligned to Contig 4600.
